Project Overview: OrderFlow
1. Project Name:

OrderFlow

2. Vision:

OrderFlow is a modular order and inventory management system designed for small and medium businesses (SMBs) to manage orders, inventory, and customer interactions seamlessly — whether online or offline.

We’re building it to simulate a production-level microservice architecture while solving real pain points for growing African and global businesses.

🧩 3. The Problem

Most small and mid-size businesses in Kenya and across Africa use manual spreadsheets, WhatsApp, or fragmented apps to manage orders and stock.
This creates:

Disorganized records

Inventory mismatches

Delayed payments

Poor customer tracking

No analytics or insight

Businesses need a unified, simple, and affordable solution that automates their entire order flow — from request to payment to delivery — without needing complex ERP systems.

💡 4. The Solution — OrderFlow

OrderFlow provides:

A centralized dashboard to manage orders, payments, and inventory.

Smart notifications for low stock, pending orders, and due invoices.

AI-assisted documentation and reporting (via OpenAI).

Multi-channel support — web dashboard for admins, API endpoints for integrations, and optional mobile access.

It’s a real-world, production-ready architecture — a blend of speed (Go), flexibility (Django), and beautiful UX (React + Tailwind + ShadCN).

⚙️ 5. System Architecture

We’re building it as microservices, each isolated and containerized via Docker, all communicating over APIs.

Service	Tech Stack	Responsibility
Frontend	React + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI	Admin dashboard, analytics, and order management UI
Go Backend (Core Service)	Go + Gin/Fiber + PostgreSQL	Order processing, user management, and API gateway
Django Service (AI & Docs)	Django REST Framework + OpenAI API	Generates reports, invoices, and AI-based documentation
Cache Layer	Redis	Stores session data, temporary analytics, and quick queries
Database	PostgreSQL	Stores user, order, and product data
Infra	Docker + Docker Compose	Orchestrates all services locally and in production
🖥️ 6. Frontend Design (React + Tailwind + ShadCN UI)
Sections:

Login / Register

Dashboard Overview

Real-time analytics (total orders, revenue, customers)

Orders Management

Create, update, track order status

Inventory Management

Add/edit products, stock alerts

Payments

Process, confirm, and reconcile payments

Reports & AI Docs

Auto-generate monthly reports via the Django + OpenAI service

Settings

Manage users, roles, and business details

Design Focus:

Smooth, professional layout (ShadCN UI)

Mobile-friendly

Dark/light mode

Loading skeletons and animations

💳 7. Payment Integration

Since we’re focusing on Kenya and scalability across Africa, we’ll support:

M-PESA STK Push (Safaricom Daraja API)

Card Payments (Stripe / Paystack)

Bank Transfers (optional for enterprise use)

Each transaction will trigger an update to the Go backend, which then updates the order status and stores payment logs in PostgreSQL.

🎯 8. Target Customers

SMEs (retailers, wholesalers, online sellers)

E-commerce startups

Local shops managing both physical and online orders

B2B suppliers who need automated invoicing and tracking

🧠 10. Why This Project Is Valuable

It gives hands-on experience with real enterprise workflows — APIs, caching, containerization, version control, and CI/CD.

It’s portfolio-ready — demonstrates full-stack, distributed systems, and teamwork.

It’s scalable — can evolve into a SaaS for businesses in Africa.

It enforces discipline and structure — repos, branches, wikis, and issue tracking.

🧭 12. Branching Model

main → stable production

dev → integration testing

feature/* → new features

fix/* → bug patches

docs/* → wiki/documentation updates

🏁 13. Collaboration Plan

Each member owns one or two services.

We’ll use GitHub Projects (Kanban) for task tracking.

All merges go through PRs reviewed by teammates.

Every service has its own README + Dockerfile + .env.example.

📦 14. Deployment Plan

Local orchestration via Docker Compose

Production deployment on Render, Fly.io, or AWS

Shared .env for environment management

Automated builds & tests using GitHub Actions
